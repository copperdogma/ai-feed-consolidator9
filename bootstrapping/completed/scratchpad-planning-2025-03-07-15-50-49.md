# Scratchpad - Requirements Phase

**Current Phase**: MVP Requirements Gathering

**MVP Checklist**
- [x] Define core problem and purpose:
  - [x] Who are the target users? (Developer themselves and potentially family members)
  - [x] What problem does this solve for them? (Managing content from various services)
  - [x] How will users measure success? (See Success Criteria section in requirements.md)
- [x] Identify MVP features (must-haves only):
  - [x] Core functionality (1-3 key capabilities)
    - Platform integration (YouTube, X, RSS)
    - Content summarization
    - Priority management
  - [x] Critical constraints or requirements
    - Personal use focus
    - Performance criteria
  - [x] Minimum user journey/flow
    - Flag content on platform -> Sync to app -> View summarized content -> Prioritize
- [x] Separate nice-to-haves from essentials:
  - [x] Future enhancements (post-MVP)
    - Advanced topic refinement
    - Enhanced learning system
    - Slack integration
    - Additional platforms
    - Advanced search/filter
    - Export capabilities
    - Mobile interface
  - [x] Stretch goals
    - Family sharing
- [x] Document in `/docs/requirements.md`:
  - [x] Clear MVP definition
  - [x] Prioritized feature list
  - [x] User stories for core flows
  - [x] Any non-requirements details or outstanding questions in the "Non-Requirements Detail" section at the bottom

**Project Type Selection**
- [ ] Determine appropriate project type:
  - [ ] Review available types in `/bootstrapping/project-types/`
  - [ ] Analyze options:
     - [ ] Programming: For software development projects
     - [ ] Research: For research-oriented projects
     - [ ] [Other types as available]
  - [ ] Provide rationale for recommendation
- [ ] Present options with clear descriptions
- [ ] If user discusses implementation details prematurely:
  - [x] Document these in the "Non-Requirements Detail" section at the bottom of requirements.md for later
  - [ ] Guide back to project type selection first
- [ ] Get explicit confirmation of project type choice

**Ready to Build?**
- When the MVP is clearly defined and project type selected, ask:
  "I think we have enough requirements for an MVP version of the project. Would you like to start building with the [selected_project_type] project type?"
- If yes, run: `./bootstrapping/scripts/transition_to_execute.sh [project_type]`
    - Then read the new scratchpad.mdc and scratchpad.md and follow the new instructions.
