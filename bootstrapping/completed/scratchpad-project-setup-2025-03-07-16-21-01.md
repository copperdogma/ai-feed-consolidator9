# Scratchpad - Planning Phase

@scratchpad.md already exists and is your external memory. Use it to help you stay on track.

**Current Phase**: Planning

**Tasks**  
- [x] Use `/docs/templates/design-template.md` to create `/docs/design.md`
- [x] Use `/docs/templates/architecture-template.md` to create `/docs/architecture.md`  
- [x] Use `/docs/templates/stories-template.md` to create the set of stories for this project `/docs/stories/stories.md`
- [x] Check the `Non-Requirements Detail` section of `requirements.md` and move anything you find there into the newly created design.md or architecture.md documents.
- [x] Remove the `Non-Requirements Detail` section of `requirements.md` once you've verified you've captured all of that detail in design.md or architecture.md.
- [x] Add a task item in this document for each story added to `/docs/stories/stories.md`  
- [x] Use `/docs/templates/story-template.md` to create each story like so: `/docs/stories/story-001.md`
