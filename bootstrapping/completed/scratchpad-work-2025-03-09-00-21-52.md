# Scratchpad - Project Setup Phase

**Current Phase**: Project Setup

**NOTES**
- Do NOT start building the actual app. That's done in the next phase.
- Update this checklist after every step

**Tasks**  
- [x] Read `/docs/architecture.md` to understand the technical requirements but don't act yet.
- [x] Read `/bootstrapping/project-types/programming/project-setup/starter-repos.md` to get the curated list URLs.
- [x] Visit ONLY the URLs provided in the starter-repos.md file as starting points.
- [x] For each URL in starter-repos.md:
   - [x] Navigate to relevant sections that match the project requirements.
   - [x] Document the navigation path through the curated list.
   - [x] Identify potential repositories that match the architecture requirements.
- [x] Ensure you've explored all URLs in starter-repos.md before proceeding.
- [x] For each identified repository, document:
   - [x] Source URL (must be from the lists in starter-repos.md)
   - [x] Path through curated lists
   - [x] Features that match requirements
   - [x] Missing features
   - [x] Compatibility score (1-10)
- [x] Present the top 3 repositories to the user with detailed analysis.
- [x] If unable to find 3 suitable repositories from the URLs in starter-repos.md, report specific difficulties and request permission for broader web searches.
- [x] Make a checklist in this document of what steps are needed to either a) pull and configure the chosen starter repo, or b) install and configure the chosen custom architecture.
- [x] If you pulled a starter repo, check its README file for a project overview and add the setup steps you find there to this checklist.
- [x] Configure development tools (e.g., ESLint, Prettier)  
- [x] Set up version control (e.g., git init)
- [x] Erase and rewrite the README.md file so it's perfect for this newly set up project
- [x] Document the new project structure in `/docs/design.md`
- [x] Fix Docker container configuration to include Firebase dependencies
- [x] Identify where to add OpenAI API integration
- [x] Double check all steps are complete before moving on to the next phase
