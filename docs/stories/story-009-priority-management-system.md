**Status**: To Do

---

## Related Requirement
This story relates to the [Efficient Consumption](../requirements.md#fundamental-principles) principle and the [Content Organization](../requirements.md#2-content-organization) section of the requirements document, particularly the need for quick priority management.

## Alignment with Design
This story aligns with the [Priority Management](../design.md#priority-management) subsection in the Content Organization feature section of the design document.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Priority levels are defined (High, Medium, Low)
- Users can manually set priority for any content item
- Automatic priority suggestions are implemented
- Priority changes are tracked in the activity history
- Content can be filtered and sorted by priority
- Priority-based views are implemented
- Visual indicators display priority levels clearly
- Priority updates are reflected immediately in the UI
- Bulk priority management is available

## Tasks
- [ ] Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles for all implemented features:
  - [ ] Write tests before implementing the feature code
  - [ ] Ensure all code has appropriate test coverage
  - [ ] Run tests continuously during development
- [ ] Define priority system:
  - [ ] Create priority level enum (High, Medium, Low)
  - [ ] Define priority data model in database
  - [ ] Implement priority metadata storage
  - [ ] Create priority change tracking
  - [ ] Define priority rules framework
- [ ] Implement manual priority management:
  - [ ] Create priority setting UI components
  - [ ] Implement priority toggle controls
  - [ ] Add priority selection in content views
  - [ ] Create priority change API endpoints
  - [ ] Implement bulk priority update functionality
- [ ] Develop automatic priority rules:
  - [ ] Create source-based priority rules
  - [ ] Implement keyword-based priority detection
  - [ ] Add topic-based priority suggestions
  - [ ] Create time-based priority adjustment
  - [ ] Implement priority rule configuration UI
- [ ] Create priority visualization:
  - [ ] Design priority indicators for content cards
  - [ ] Implement priority-based coloring or badges
  - [ ] Create priority level icons or symbols
  - [ ] Add priority indicators in lists and details
  - [ ] Implement priority change animations
- [ ] Implement priority-based views:
  - [ ] Create High Priority content view
  - [ ] Implement priority filtering controls
  - [ ] Add priority-based sorting options
  - [ ] Create priority distribution visualization
  - [ ] Implement priority statistics view
- [ ] Develop priority synchronization:
  - [ ] Create priority change event system
  - [ ] Implement real-time priority updates
  - [ ] Add priority data caching for performance
  - [ ] Ensure cross-device priority consistency
- [ ] Implement priority analytics:
  - [ ] Track priority changes over time
  - [ ] Create priority distribution reports
  - [ ] Implement content consumption by priority
  - [ ] Add priority effectiveness metrics
  - [ ] Create priority trend visualization

## Notes
- Priority management is a core feature for effective content consumption
- The system should make priority adjustment quick and intuitive
- Consider keyboard shortcuts for quick priority changes
- Priority visualization should be clear and consistent across views
- Priority rules should be transparent and understandable to users
- Consider automatic priority decay for older content
- Priority analytics can provide insights into content consumption patterns
