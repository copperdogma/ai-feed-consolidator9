# Story: Content Summarization with OpenAI

**Status**: To Do

---

## Related Requirement
This story relates to the [Summary Generation](../requirements.md#2-content-organization) section of the requirements document, specifically the "Intelligent Content Summarization" and "Direct ChatGPT integration" requirements.

## Alignment with Design
This story aligns with the [Content Summarization](../design.md#feature-content-summarization) section of the design document and the [AI Processing Architecture](../architecture.md#ai-processing-architecture) section of the architecture document.

## Acceptance Criteria
- OpenAI API integration is implemented
- Two-level summary system is created:
  - Brief 1-3 sentence overview for quick scanning
  - Detailed summary for deeper understanding
- Summaries are stored in the database to avoid regeneration
- Fallback to GPT-3.5-turbo is implemented for cost optimization
- Time-to-consume estimates are generated for content
- Content complexity is detected and flagged when too complex for brief summary
- Summaries meet the quality criteria specified in the requirements

## Tasks
- [ ] Set up OpenAI API integration:
  - [ ] Configure API access with environment variables
  - [ ] Implement API client with rate limiting and error handling
  - [ ] Create testing utilities for the API
- [ ] Design and implement prompt templates:
  - [ ] Create prompt for brief summary generation
  - [ ] Create prompt for detailed summary generation
  - [ ] Test prompts with various content types
  - [ ] Optimize prompts for token efficiency
- [ ] Implement two-level summary system:
  - [ ] Create service for brief summary generation
  - [ ] Create service for detailed summary generation
  - [ ] Implement model selection logic (GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5-turbo)
  - [ ] Add content type detection for prompt customization
- [ ] Implement database storage:
  - [ ] Create database schema for summaries
  - [ ] Implement repository for summary storage and retrieval
  - [ ] Add caching layer to avoid unnecessary API calls
- [ ] Implement time-to-consume estimation:
  - [ ] Create algorithm for reading time estimation
  - [ ] Create algorithm for video/audio duration extraction
  - [ ] Store estimates in the database
- [ ] Implement content complexity detection:
  - [ ] Create algorithm to assess content complexity
  - [ ] Add flagging system for complex content
  - [ ] Store complexity metrics in the database
- [ ] Create API endpoints:
  - [ ] Endpoint to generate summaries for content
  - [ ] Endpoint to retrieve existing summaries
  - [ ] Endpoint to regenerate summaries if needed
- [ ] Implement frontend components:
  - [ ] Summary display component
  - [ ] Summary loading state
  - [ ] Error handling for failed summarization
  - [ ] Toggle between brief and detailed summaries

## Notes
- OpenAI API costs should be carefully monitored
- Caching is critical to avoid unnecessary API calls
- Consider implementing a queue system for batch processing
- Prompt engineering is crucial for quality summaries
- Test with various content types to ensure robustness
- Consider implementing a feedback mechanism to improve summaries over time
