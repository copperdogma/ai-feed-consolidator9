## Notes
- Content views should load quickly and feel responsive
- Navigation between views should be intuitive and consistent
- Consider keyboard shortcuts for view navigation
- The views should adapt to different screen sizes gracefully
- Empty states should provide guidance on how to add content
- Content ordering should be consistent and predictable
- Consider implementing view bookmarking for quick access
