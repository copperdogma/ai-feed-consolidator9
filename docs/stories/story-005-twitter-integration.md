# Story: X/Twitter Integration

**Status**: To Do

---

## Related Requirement
This story relates to the [Content Integration](../requirements.md#1-content-integration) section of the requirements document, specifically the integration with "X/Twitter (Bookmarks)" as a content source.

## Alignment with Design
This story aligns with the [X/Twitter Integration](../design.md#xtwitter-integration) subsection in the Content Integration feature section of the design document.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can authenticate with their X/Twitter account
- System can access user's bookmarked tweets
- Tweet content and metadata are extracted and stored
- Bookmark status is synchronized between the app and X/Twitter
- Tweets can be prioritized within the app
- Media content in tweets (images, videos) is properly handled
- Thread context is preserved for bookmarked tweets within threads
- User mentions and hashtags are properly processed
- Time-to-consume estimates are calculated for tweets and threads
- API rate limits are respected

## Tasks

  - [ ] Process media attachments (images, videos)
  - [ ] Handle links and cards in tweets
  - [ ] Process user mentions and hashtags
  - [ ] Detect and process thread relationships
- [ ] Implement bookmark status management:
  - [ ] Track read/unread status
  - [ ] Synchronize status between app and X/Twitter
  - [ ] Create read history view
- [ ] Develop UI components:
  - [ ] Create tweet card component

- [ ] Implement synchronization service:
  - [ ] Create background sync process
  - [ ] Add configurable sync intervals
  - [ ] Implement efficient delta updates
  - [ ] Add manual sync trigger
  - [ ] Create sync status indicators
- [ ] Handle thread context:
  - [ ] Detect when bookmarked tweet is part of a thread
  - [ ] Fetch parent tweet context
  - [ ] Fetch child tweet context
  - [ ] Create thread view component
  - [ ] Implement thread expansion/collapse

## Notes
- X/Twitter API has strict rate limits that need to be managed carefully
- API authorization requires ongoing verification with X/Twitter
- Consider caching strategies to minimize API usage
- Media content may need special handling for different formats
- Thread detection and assembly can be complex
- Be aware of potential API changes as X/Twitter evolves
- Consider implementing a "view on X/Twitter" feature to open tweets directly
