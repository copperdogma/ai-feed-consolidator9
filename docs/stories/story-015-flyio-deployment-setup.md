# Story: fly.io Deployment Setup

**Status**: To Do

---

## Related Requirement
This story relates to the [Deployment Strategy](../requirements.md#deployment-strategy) section of the requirements document, specifically the "Cloud: fly.io using existing account" requirement.

## Alignment with Design
This story aligns with the [Deployment](../design.md#deployment) section of the design document and the [Deployment Strategy](../architecture.md#deployment-strategy) section of the architecture document.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Notes
- fly.io has specific configuration requirements that differ from pure Docker
- PostgreSQL setup on fly.io has its own considerations
- Cost optimization is important for personal projects
- Consider setting up multiple regions if needed for performance
- fly.io offers many built-in features that should be leveraged
- Monitoring is essential for a reliable deployment
- Documentation should be thorough for future maintenance
