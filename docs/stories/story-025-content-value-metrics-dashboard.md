# Story: Content Value Metrics Dashboard

**Status**: To Do

---

## Related Requirement
This story relates to the [Summary Generation](../requirements.md#2-content-organization) section of the requirements document, specifically supporting the quality measurement of content processing features.

## Alignment with Design
This story aligns with the [Content Summarization](../design.md#feature-content-summarization) section of the design document and implements the metrics defined in the [Content Value Metrics](../content-value-metrics.md) document, based on principles from [Content Value Principles](../content-value-principles.md).

## Acceptance Criteria
- A dashboard is implemented that tracks all core metrics defined in the Content Value Metrics document
- Metrics are displayed with trends over time (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Metrics can be filtered by content type and summary level
- The dashboard highlights metrics that fall below target thresholds
- Drill-down capability allows exploration of individual content items that performed poorly
- User satisfaction ratings are collected and incorporated into the dashboard
- Dashboard supports exporting data for further analysis
- A/B testing functionality allows comparison of different summarization approaches
- The dashboard includes visualizations that make it easy to identify trends and issues
- API endpoints provide programmatic access to metrics data

## Tasks
- [ ] Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles for all implemented features:
  - [ ] Write tests before implementing the feature code
  - [ ] Ensure all code has appropriate test coverage
  - [ ] Run tests continuously during development
- [ ] Design the metrics collection system:
  - [ ] Create database schema for storing metrics data
  - [ ] Design API endpoints for submitting metrics
  - [ ] Implement data validation and sanitization
  - [ ] Create batch processing for historical data
- [ ] Implement automated metrics collection:
  - [ ] Develop Information Density Ratio calculator
  - [ ] Create Content Value Principle Coverage analyzer
  - [ ] Build user feedback collection mechanism
  - [ ] Implement integration with Answer-Forward Testing
- [ ] Design dashboard UI:
  - [ ] Create wireframes for dashboard layout
  - [ ] Design metric cards and visualizations
  - [ ] Implement responsive design for different devices
  - [ ] Create filter and search functionality
- [ ] Implement dashboard frontend:
  - [ ] Develop metrics overview page
  - [ ] Create detailed metric exploration views
  - [ ] Implement trend analysis visualizations
  - [ ] Build content drill-down functionality
  - [ ] Create A/B testing comparison views
- [ ] Implement backend services:
  - [ ] Create API for retrieving metrics data
  - [ ] Build caching layer for performance
  - [ ] Implement authentication and authorization
  - [ ] Create scheduled jobs for metrics aggregation
- [ ] Develop alerting system:
  - [ ] Implement threshold-based alerts
  - [ ] Create notification delivery mechanisms
  - [ ] Build alert management interface
  - [ ] Implement alert history and resolution tracking
- [ ] Create documentation:
  - [ ] Write user guide for dashboard
  - [ ] Document metrics definitions and calculations
  - [ ] Create developer documentation for metrics API
  - [ ] Provide examples of using metrics for improvements

## Notes
- The dashboard should be designed with performance in mind, as it will process large amounts of data
- Consider implementing progressive loading for larger datasets
- Ensure the system can handle the addition of new metrics in the future
- The dashboard should be useful for both developers and content managers
- Initial implementation may focus on a subset of metrics, with others added over time
- Consider integrating with existing analytics platforms if available
- The system should support both automated and manual metric collection
- Ensure proper security measures for handling potentially sensitive content data
- Design the system to minimize impact on production services when collecting metrics
- Consider implementing a feedback loop where metrics inform improvements to summarization algorithms
- The dashboard should help identify patterns across content types and processing levels
