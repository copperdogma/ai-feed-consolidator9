# Story: Structured Logging System

**Status**: To Do

---

## Related Requirement
This story relates to the overall system reliability, debugging capabilities, and operational transparency requirements implicit in the project.

## Alignment with Design
This story enhances the system architecture with improved observability and debugging capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A centralized structured logging system is implemented
- Multi-target logging is supported (console, file)
- All application components use the centralized logger
- Standardized log categories are defined and used consistently
- Log levels are appropriate for different environments
- Contextual information is included in all log entries
- Log formatting is consistent and machine-parseable (JSON)
- Development environment has pretty-printed logs for readability
- Log-based verification utilities are available for testing and debugging
- Log rotation and management is configured for production

## Tasks
- [ ] Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles for all implemented features:
  - [ ] Write tests before implementing the feature code
  - [ ] Ensure all code has appropriate test coverage
  - [ ] Run tests continuously during development
- [ ] Design logging architecture:
  - [ ] Research and select appropriate logging library (e.g., Pino)
  - [ ] Create centralized logger configuration
  - [ ] Define standard log structure and fields
  - [ ] Implement environment-specific configuration
- [ ] Implement core logging functionality:
  - [ ] Create centralized logger instance
  - [ ] Implement multi-target output (console, file)
  - [ ] Configure pretty-printing for development
  - [ ] Set up log rotation for production
- [ ] Define log categories and levels:
  - [ ] Create standardized log categories
  - [ ] Define appropriate log levels for different scenarios
  - [ ] Implement category-specific formatting
  - [ ] Create helper functions for common log patterns
- [ ] Enhance contextual logging:
  - [ ] Implement request context tracking
  - [ ] Add user/session context to logs where appropriate
  - [ ] Create operation ID generation for tracing requests
  - [ ] Add timing information for performance monitoring
- [ ] Create log-based verification utilities:
  - [ ] Implement log stream capture for testing
  - [ ] Create assertion helpers for log content
  - [ ] Build log analysis utilities
  - [ ] Add debug helper functions
- [ ] Implement error logging enhancements:
  - [ ] Create standardized error logging format
  - [ ] Add stack trace formatting
  - [ ] Implement context preservation for errors
  - [ ] Add correlation IDs for related errors
- [ ] Integrate with existing components:
  - [ ] Update HTTP request/response logging
  - [ ] Enhance database operation logging
  - [ ] Improve external API call logging
  - [ ] Update feed processing logs

## Notes
- Balance between detailed logging and performance
- Consider log storage and retention policies
- Ensure sensitive data is not logged (PII, credentials)
- Standardize log format across all components
- Log levels should be configurable via environment variables
- Consider adding log aggregation capabilities for production
- Design logs to be easily searchable and filterable
- Implement log sampling for high-volume operations
- Consider integration with monitoring systems
