# Story: Robust Error Handling Framework

**Status**: To Do

---

## Related Requirement
This story relates to the overall system reliability and stability requirements implicit in the project requirements document.

## Alignment with Design
This story aligns with the system architecture and implements patterns for robust error handling across all components.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A comprehensive error handling framework is implemented across the application
- Standardized error categories are defined and used consistently
- All external integrations use proper error handling patterns
- Detailed error logging with contextual information is implemented
- Error recovery strategies are in place for common failure scenarios
- Feed validation and health monitoring is enhanced with detailed error tracking
- Graduated retry mechanisms are implemented for transient errors
- Source-specific handlers exist for problematic feed sources

## Tasks
- [ ] Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles for all implemented features:
  - [ ] Write tests before implementing the feature code
  - [ ] Ensure all code has appropriate test coverage
  - [ ] Run tests continuously during development
- [ ] Define error handling architecture:
  - [ ] Create standardized error categories and types
  - [ ] Implement base error classes with proper inheritance
  - [ ] Define error context structure for detailed logging
  - [ ] Create documentation for error handling patterns
- [ ] Implement core error handling utilities:
  - [ ] Develop safe operation wrapper functions
  - [ ] Create result/error pattern implementation
  - [ ] Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
  - [ ] Build error recovery strategies for common scenarios
- [ ] Enhance feed validation system:
  - [ ] Implement FeedHealth tracking interface and repository
  - [ ] Create comprehensive feed validation pipeline
  - [ ] Develop source-specific handlers for problematic feeds
  - [ ] Implement permanent vs. transient error distinction
- [ ] Improve error logging:
  - [ ] Enhance logger configuration for structured logging
  - [ ] Add context information to all error logs
  - [ ] Create log analysis utilities
  - [ ] Implement log-based verification helpers
- [ ] Create recovery mechanisms:
  - [ ] Implement database reconnection logic
  - [ ] Add connection pool monitoring and management
  - [ ] Create service degradation strategies
  - [ ] Build circuit breaker pattern implementation
- [ ] Implement verification utilities:
  - [ ] Create log-based verification helpers
  - [ ] Implement verification workflows for critical operations
  - [ ] Build monitoring for component health
  - [ ] Add diagnostic endpoints for system status
- [ ] Integrate with existing components:
  - [ ] Update RSS feed integration to use the new framework
  - [ ] Enhance database operations with safe operation patterns
  - [ ] Improve API endpoints with consistent error handling
  - [ ] Update external integrations with retry mechanisms

## Notes
- This framework should be applied consistently across all components
- Error handling should be unobtrusive and not impact code readability
- Performance impact of error handling should be minimized
- Balance between detailed logging and performance must be maintained
- Recovery strategies should be tailored to specific components
- Implement common patterns to make error handling consistent
- Categorize errors properly to enable appropriate handling strategies
- Special focus on feed source error handling for improved reliability
