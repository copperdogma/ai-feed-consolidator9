# Story: Historical Feed Implementation

**Status**: To Do

---

## Related Requirement
This story relates to the [Historical Feed](../requirements.md#4-historical-feed) section of the requirements document and the [Complete History](../requirements.md#fundamental-principles) fundamental principle.

## Alignment with Design
This story aligns with the [Historical Data Management](../design.md#historical-data-management) and [Search and Filter](../design.md#search-and-filter) subsections in the Historical Feed feature section of the design document.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Historical content is preserved and accessible
- Infinite scroll interface is implemented for browsing history
- Performance is optimized for large content sets
- Advanced search and filter options are available
- Content consumption status is tracked historically
- Activity tracking is implemented for user actions
- Historical content is accessible within 2 clicks
- Read/viewed status is accurately tracked
- Priority changes are tracked over time

## Tasks
- [ ] Design historical data architecture:
  - [ ] Define historical data retention policies
  - [ ] Create historical data storage model
  - [ ] Design activity tracking schema
  - [ ] Implement data archiving strategy
  - [ ] Create historical data access patterns

  - [ ] Create database indexes for historical queries
  - [ ] Implement data caching mechanisms
  - [ ] Add result set pagination
  - [ ] Create query optimization strategies
  - [ ] Implement data prefetching
- [ ] Create historical view components:
  - [ ] Implement historical timeline view
  - [ ] Create activity history view
  - [ ] Add content change history
  - [ ] Implement content version comparison
  - [ ] Create historical statistics visualization
- [ ] Implement consumption tracking:
  - [ ] Create read/viewed status tracking
  - [ ] Implement partial consumption progress
  - [ ] Add consumption time tracking
  - [ ] Create consumption patterns analysis
  - [ ] Implement consumption history view
- [ ] Develop activity tracking:
  - [ ] Create activity logging system
  - [ ] Implement activity categorization
  - [ ] Add activity timeline view
  - [ ] Create activity search functionality
  - [ ] Implement activity analytics
- [ ] Implement historical navigation:
  - [ ] Create quick access to recent history
  - [ ] Implement history-based suggestions
  - [ ] Add date-based history navigation
  - [ ] Create history browsing shortcuts
  - [ ] Implement history organization tools

## Notes
- Historical data management is critical for the "Complete History" principle
- Balance between data retention and performance is important
- Consider data archiving strategies for older content
- Privacy implications of historical data should be considered
- Activity tracking should be unobtrusive but comprehensive
- Historical views should be fast and responsive despite large data sets
- Consider implementing data compression for historical content
