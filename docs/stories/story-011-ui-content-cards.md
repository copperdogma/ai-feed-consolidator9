**Status**: To Do

---

## Related Requirement
This story relates to the [User Interface](../requirements.md#3-user-interface) section of the requirements document, specifically the content cards requirements showing essential information and quick actions.

## Alignment with Design
This story aligns with the [Content Views](../design.md#content-views) subsection in the User Interface feature section of the design document, particularly the content card components.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Reusable content card components are implemented
- Cards display essential content information:
  - Title
  - Source platform
  - Time to consume
  - Summary preview
  - Priority status
  - Topic tags
- Quick actions are available directly on cards:
  - Toggle priority
  - Mark consumed
  - Open original
  - Expand summary
- Cards adapt to different content types (articles, videos, tweets, emails)
- Cards are responsive and work on different screen sizes
- Cards are accessible and keyboard navigable
- Cards have appropriate loading and error states
- Card appearance can be customized through settings

## Notes
- Content cards are the primary interface for content interaction
- Card design should balance information density with readability
- Consider dark mode support for cards
- Accessibility is important, including screen reader support
- Performance is critical when rendering many cards
- Cards should have consistent layout while adapting to content types
- Card actions should be intuitive and easily accessible
