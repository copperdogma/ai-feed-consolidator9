# Story: gptAnalyze Deep Analysis Component

**Status**: To Do

---

## Related Requirement
This story relates to the [Summary Generation](../requirements.md#2-content-organization) section of the requirements document, specifically the "Direct ChatGPT integration" requirement.

## Alignment with Design
This story aligns with the [Content Summarization](../design.md#feature-content-summarization) section of the design document, particularly the Deep Analysis Integration subsection, and the [Content Value Principles](../content-value-principles.md) document.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A gptAnalyze feature is implemented for direct ChatGPT deep analysis
- The component generates content-specific analysis prompts that address all five Content Value Principles
- Analysis is opened in a new tab to preserve application context
- The feature is available from both content cards and detail views
- Usage analytics are tracked to measure feature adoption
- Content-type specific prompts are implemented for different content categories
- The feature is visually integrated with the existing UI
- Users understand what happens when activating the feature
- The deep analysis prompt includes critical evaluation of assumptions, evidence, and gaps
- The analysis addresses all five Content Value Principles: Purpose & Nature, Novelty & Change, Truth & Information Quality, Context & Dependencies, and Perspective & Framing

## Tasks
- [ ] Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles for all implemented features:
  - [ ] Write tests before implementing the feature code
  - [ ] Ensure all code has appropriate test coverage
  - [ ] Run tests continuously during development
- [ ] Design core gptAnalyze functionality:
  - [ ] Create utility function for generating ChatGPT URLs with analysis prompts
  - [ ] Implement URL encoding and parameter handling
  - [ ] Create mechanism for opening URLs in new tabs
  - [ ] Add error handling for edge cases
- [ ] Implement enhanced analysis prompt that covers all Content Value Principles:
  - [ ] Implement core prompt structure:
    ```
    Analyze [URL]
    
    Please search the web and provide:
    1. Main arguments and key findings
    2. Supporting evidence and data
    3. Context and implications
    4. Notable quotes or statements
    5. Technical details or methodologies
    6. Critical evaluation of:
       - Implicit assumptions in the reasoning
       - How well conclusions follow from evidence
       - Gaps or ambiguities that undermine arguments
       - Alternative interpretations or perspectives
    ```
  - [ ] Map prompt sections to Content Value Principles
  - [ ] Add prompt variants for different content types
  - [ ] Create fallback prompts for when URL is not available
- [ ] Implement content-type specific prompts:
  - [ ] Develop technical content analysis prompt with emphasis on Truth & Information Quality
  - [ ] Create news content analysis prompt with emphasis on Novelty & Change
  - [ ] Implement analysis content prompt with emphasis on Perspective & Framing
  - [ ] Design tutorial content prompt with emphasis on Purpose & Nature
  - [ ] Build entertainment content prompt with appropriate focus
- [ ] Create UI components:
  - [ ] Design gptAnalyze button with appropriate icon
  - [ ] Implement button component with proper styling
  - [ ] Add tooltip explaining the feature
  - [ ] Create visual feedback for button activation
- [ ] Integrate with existing components:
  - [ ] Add gptAnalyze button to content cards
  - [ ] Implement button in content detail view
  - [ ] Ensure proper spacing and layout
  - [ ] Make button responsive on different devices
- [ ] Implement usage tracking:
  - [ ] Create analytics events for feature activation
  - [ ] Track content types being analyzed
  - [ ] Measure frequency of use
  - [ ] Implement reporting dashboard
- [ ] Document the feature:
  - [ ] Create user documentation explaining the feature
  - [ ] Add developer documentation for implementation details
  - [ ] Include examples of prompts for different content types
  - [ ] Document how prompts address Content Value Principles
  - [ ] Document analytics interpretation

## Notes
- This feature leverages ChatGPT's existing capabilities without additional API costs
- The implementation is relatively simple but adds significant analytical value
- Consider A/B testing different prompt structures to optimize effectiveness
- Ensure the UI makes it clear that this will open ChatGPT in a new tab
- Track how often users utilize this feature vs. the built-in summaries
- Consider future enhancements like:
  - Saving analysis results back to the application
  - Customizing prompts based on user preferences
  - Adding ability to share analyses with other users
  - Providing templates for different analysis needs
- While implementation is straightforward, prompt design is crucial for quality results
- The comprehensive prompt ensures all five Content Value Principles are addressed
- Different content types may require emphasis on different principles
- Balance between structure and open-ended analysis for best results
