# Story: Summary Quality Testing Framework

**Status**: To Do

---

## Related Requirement
This story relates to the [Summary Generation](../requirements.md#2-content-organization) section of the requirements document, specifically the "Intelligent Content Summarization" requirement by ensuring high-quality summaries.

## Alignment with Design
This story aligns with the [Content Summarization](../design.md#feature-content-summarization) section of the design document, particularly the Quality Testing Framework subsection.

## Acceptance Criteria
- An automated system to evaluate summary quality is implemented
- The system uses a more capable model (GPT-4) to evaluate summaries produced by less capable models (GPT-3.5)
- The evaluation assesses multiple quality factors including:
  - Answer completeness (answers obvious follow-up questions)
  - Missing critical information
  - Presence of superfluous information
  - Overall clarity and accuracy
- The system generates improvement suggestions for low-quality summaries
- Cost and latency metrics are tracked for optimization
- A feedback loop is established to refine prompts based on evaluation results
- Quality metrics are stored and tracked over time to measure improvement

## Tasks
- [ ] Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles for all implemented features:
  - [ ] Write tests before implementing the feature code
  - [ ] Ensure all code has appropriate test coverage
  - [ ] Run tests continuously during development
- [ ] Design the evaluation system architecture:
  - [ ] Define interfaces for evaluation requests and responses
  - [ ] Create service for GPT-4 evaluation calls
  - [ ] Implement metrics collection and storage
- [ ] Implement the TestResult interface and related models:
  - [ ] Define fields for original content, summary, and evaluation results
  - [ ] Create schema for evaluation metrics (clarity, accuracy, etc.)
  - [ ] Implement cost and latency tracking
- [ ] Develop the evaluation prompt engineering:
  - [ ] Create system prompt for GPT-4 evaluator
  - [ ] Design criteria-specific prompts (per content type)
  - [ ] Implement JSON response formatting
- [ ] Create the Answer-Forward testing components:
  - [ ] Implement natural question generation from summaries
  - [ ] Create validation logic against content type-specific question sets
  - [ ] Design scoring system for answer completeness
- [ ] Build the continuous improvement pipeline:
  - [ ] Create aggregation logic for feedback patterns
  - [ ] Implement prompt refinement suggestions
  - [ ] Develop A/B testing framework for prompt variants
- [ ] Implement the evaluation service:
  - [ ] Create evaluation queue for batch processing
  - [ ] Build retry logic for failed evaluations
  - [ ] Implement caching to avoid duplicate evaluations
- [ ] Create admin dashboard components:
  - [ ] Summary quality metrics visualization
  - [ ] Cost/performance analysis charts
  - [ ] Model comparison tools
  - [ ] Prompt effectiveness tracking
- [ ] Develop automated testing for the framework:
  - [ ] Create test suite with diverse content samples
  - [ ] Implement integration tests for the full pipeline
  - [ ] Create performance benchmarks
- [ ] Build feedback integration:
  - [ ] Create database schema for evaluation history
  - [ ] Implement prompt updating based on aggregated feedback
  - [ ] Develop reporting for quality trends

## Notes
- GPT-4 API costs for evaluation should be carefully monitored and optimized
- Consider sampling approach rather than evaluating every summary
- Batch processing during off-peak times may reduce costs
- Maintain a reference set of pre-evaluated content for regression testing
- Consider creating a human-in-the-loop validation for some percentage of evaluations
- Track cost per improvement ratio to ensure evaluation system is cost-effective
- Consider using different evaluation models for different content types or complexity levels
