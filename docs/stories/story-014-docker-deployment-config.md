# Story: Docker Deployment Configuration

**Status**: To Do

---

## Related Requirement
This story relates to the [Deployment Strategy](../requirements.md#deployment-strategy) section of the requirements document, specifically the "Docker containerization for consistent environment" requirement.

## Alignment with Design
This story aligns with the [Deployment](../design.md#deployment) section of the design document and the [Deployment Strategy](../architecture.md#deployment-strategy) section of the architecture document.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Docker configuration is set up for development environment
- Docker Compose is configured for local development
- Production Docker configuration is implemented
- PostgreSQL database is properly containerized
- Persistent data storage is configured with volumes
- Environment variable management is implemented
- Container networking is properly configured
- Docker images are optimized for size and performance
- Container security best practices are followed
- Documentation is provided for Docker usage

## Tasks
- [ ] Set up development Docker configuration:
  - [ ] Create Dockerfile for frontend
  - [ ] Create Dockerfile for backend
  - [ ] Configure Docker Compose for local development

  - [ ] Add environment-specific settings
  - [ ] Create environment validation checks
- [ ] Implement container networking:
  - [ ] Configure container network
  - [ ] Set up service discovery
  - [ ] Implement proper port mapping
  - [ ] Configure reverse proxy if needed
  - [ ] Set up SSL termination
- [ ] Develop container security:
  - [ ] Implement least privilege principle
  - [ ] Configure container hardening
  - [ ] Implement image vulnerability scanning
  - [ ] Add container resource limits
  - [ ] Create security documentation
- [ ] Create deployment documentation:
  - [ ] Document Docker setup process
  - [ ] Create container management instructions
  - [ ] Add troubleshooting guide
  - [ ] Document volume management
  - [ ] Create deployment checklist

## Notes
- Docker configuration should balance development experience with production readiness
- Consider development vs production differences carefully
- Container security is a priority
- Database persistence requires careful volume configuration
- Environment variable management is critical for configuration
- Containers should be as lightweight as possible
- Consider implementing container health monitoring
