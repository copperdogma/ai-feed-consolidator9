# Story: Answer-Forward Testing for Summaries

**Status**: To Do

---

## Related Requirement
This story relates to the [Summary Generation](../requirements.md#2-content-organization) section of the requirements document, specifically ensuring summaries are comprehensive and informative.

## Alignment with Design
This story aligns with the [Content Summarization](../design.md#feature-content-summarization) section of the design document, particularly the Answer-Forward Testing subsection, and the [Content Value Principles](../content-value-principles.md) document.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A methodology is implemented to ensure summaries preemptively answer obvious follow-up questions
- The system identifies natural questions that arise from reading a summary
- Content type-specific question sets are developed for different types based on Content Value Principles:
  - Technical: What's new, how it improves existing solutions, background needed
  - News: What changed, who's affected, when it takes effect
  - Analysis: Main arguments, evidence, assumptions
  - Tutorial: What you'll learn, prerequisites, applications
  - Entertainment: Format, genre, time investment
- Validation logic confirms summaries address critical questions
- Feedback mechanism suggests improvements for summaries that fail validation
- Integration with the summary generation process to guide prompt engineering
- Example-based validation is implemented using the validation examples from Content Value Principles
- The validation adheres to the principle: "A good summary should anticipate and answer the natural questions that arise from its own statements"

## Notes
- This methodology focuses on anticipating and answering questions that naturally arise from summaries
- The goal is to make summaries more valuable by including critical information proactively
- Consider implementing this as a library that can be reused across different summary types
- User feedback should be incorporated to refine question patterns over time
- Careful balance needed between completeness and conciseness
- Validation should focus on critical information rather than exhaustive coverage
- Consider using GPT-4 for question generation and GPT-3.5 for summaries to optimize costs
- The validation examples from Content Value Principles provide a clear baseline for quality
- Different content types have different expectations for what constitutes a complete summary
- Focus on improving the high-value content types most commonly seen in the application
