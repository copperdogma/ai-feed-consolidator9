## Notes
- YouTube API has strict quota limits that need to be managed carefully
- Watch Later playlists have special API considerations
- Consider caching strategies to minimize API usage
- OAuth tokens need secure storage and proper refresh handling
- Some users may have large playlists requiring pagination handling
- Consider implementing a "watch on YouTube" feature to open videos directly in YouTube
- Thumbnail quality selection should balance quality vs. bandwidth/storage
