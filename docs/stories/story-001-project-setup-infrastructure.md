# Story: Project Setup and Infrastructure

**Status**: To Do

---

## Related Requirement
This story relates to the overall project infrastructure requirements in the [Deployment Strategy](../requirements.md#deployment-strategy) section of the requirements document.

## Alignment with Design
This story aligns with the [Architecture Overview](../design.md#architecture-overview) and [Technology Stack](../design.md#technology-stack) sections of the design document, which specify a local PostgreSQL database with Dockerized server and client components.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Project repository is initialized with proper structure
- Docker and Docker Compose configuration is set up for server and client (not database)
- Local PostgreSQL is installed and configured
- Development environment is configured
- Basic frontend and backend applications are created
- Firebase Authentication is set up and integrated
- Database connection from Docker containers to local PostgreSQL is established
- CI/CD pipeline is configured (if applicable)

## Tasks
- [ ] Initialize Git repository with proper .gitignore
- [ ] Create project directory structure:
  - [ ] `/frontend` - React application
  - [ ] `/backend` - Node.js/Express application
  - [ ] `/database` - Database migrations and schema
  - [ ] `/docker` - Docker configuration files
- [ ] Set up Docker and Docker Compose:
  - [ ] Create Dockerfile for frontend
  - [ ] Create Dockerfile for backend
  - [ ] Configure Docker Compose to connect to local PostgreSQL
  - [x] Remove PostgreSQL container from Docker configuration
  - [x] Configure networking to allow Docker containers to access local PostgreSQL
- [ ] Set up local PostgreSQL:
  - [x] Install PostgreSQL on host machine (already installed)
  - [x] Configure PostgreSQL to accept connections from Docker
  - [x] Create initial databases for development and testing
- [ ] Initialize frontend application:
  - [ ] Set up Vite with React and TypeScript
  - [ ] Configure React Query
  - [ ] Set up basic routing
- [ ] Set up Firebase Authentication:
  - [ ] Create Firebase project
  - [ ] Configure Firebase Authentication
  - [ ] Set up user management
  - [ ] Implement login and registration components
  - [ ] Configure Firebase SDK in frontend
- [ ] Initialize backend application:
  - [ ] Set up Node.js with Express
  - [ ] Configure TypeScript
  - [ ] Set up basic API structure
  - [ ] Configure Firebase Admin SDK for token verification
  - [ ] Implement JWT middleware for API authentication
- [ ] Set up database connection:
  - [ ] Configure connection to local PostgreSQL
  - [ ] Initialize Prisma ORM
  - [ ] Create initial schema
  - [ ] Test connection from Docker containers
- [ ] Configure environment variables:
  - [ ] Create .env.example file
  - [ ] Document required environment variables
  - [ ] Add Firebase configuration variables
  - [ ] Configure database connection variables for local PostgreSQL
- [ ] Write documentation:
  - [ ] Update README.md with setup instructions
  - [ ] Document development workflow
  - [ ] Document Firebase Authentication setup
  - [ ] Document local PostgreSQL setup and connection

## Notes
- This story is foundational and must be completed before other stories can begin
- The project structure should be modular to allow for future expansion
- Security best practices should be followed from the beginning
- Consider using a monorepo approach for easier management
- Firebase Authentication should be implemented early to enable user management functionality
- Local PostgreSQL setup is required before any database operations can be performed
