# Story: Project Setup and Infrastructure

**Status**: Done

---

## Related Requirement
This story relates to the overall project infrastructure requirements in the [Deployment Strategy](../requirements.md#deployment-strategy) section of the requirements document.

## Alignment with Design
This story aligns with the [Architecture Overview](../design.md#architecture-overview) and [Technology Stack](../design.md#technology-stack) sections of the design document, which specify a local PostgreSQL database with Dockerized server and client components.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Project repository is initialized with proper structure
- Docker and Docker Compose configuration is set up for server and client (not database)
- Local PostgreSQL is installed and configured
- Development environment is configured
- Basic frontend and backend applications are created
- Firebase Authentication is set up and integrated
- Database connection from Docker containers to local PostgreSQL is established
- CI/CD pipeline is configured (if applicable)

## Tasks
- [x] Initialize Git repository with proper .gitignore
- [x] Create project directory structure:
  - [x] Use monorepo structure with packages directory:
    - [x] `packages/client` - React application
    - [x] `packages/server` - Node.js/Express application with tRPC
- [x] Set up Docker and Docker Compose:
  - [x] Create Dockerfile for client
  - [x] Create Dockerfile for server
  - [x] Configure Docker Compose to connect to local PostgreSQL
  - [x] Remove PostgreSQL container from Docker configuration
  - [x] Configure networking to allow Docker containers to access local PostgreSQL
  - [x] Add Firebase dependencies to Dockerfiles
  - [x] Configure volume mounts for hot reloading
- [x] Set up local PostgreSQL:
  - [x] Install PostgreSQL on host machine (already installed)
  - [x] Configure PostgreSQL to accept connections from Docker
  - [x] Create initial databases for development and testing
- [x] Initialize client application:
  - [x] Set up Vite with React and TypeScript
  - [x] Configure React Query
  - [x] Set up basic routing
- [x] Set up Firebase Authentication:
  - [x] Create Firebase project
  - [x] Configure Firebase Authentication
  - [x] Set up user management
  - [x] Implement login and registration components
  - [x] Configure Firebase SDK in frontend
  - [x] Add Google authentication to login and signup components
- [x] Initialize server application:
  - [x] Set up Node.js with Express
  - [x] Configure TypeScript
  - [x] Set up basic API structure with tRPC
  - [x] Configure Firebase Admin SDK for token verification
  - [x] Implement JWT middleware for API authentication
- [x] Set up database connection:
  - [x] Configure connection to local PostgreSQL
  - [x] Initialize Prisma ORM
  - [x] Create initial schema
  - [x] Test connection from Docker containers
- [x] Configure environment variables:
  - [x] Create .env file
  - [x] Document required environment variables
  - [x] Add Firebase configuration variables
  - [x] Configure database connection variables for local PostgreSQL
- [x] Write documentation:
  - [x] Create comprehensive README.md
  - [x] Document development workflow
  - [x] Document Firebase Authentication setup
  - [x] Document local PostgreSQL setup and connection

## Notes
- This story has been completed successfully
- Project structure uses a monorepo approach for easier management
- Docker containers are now properly configured with Firebase dependencies
- Hot reloading has been implemented for better development experience:
  - Volume mounts for source code directories allow immediate reflection of changes
  - Special handling for node_modules prevents dependency conflicts
  - Vite configured with host flags for external connections
  - Docker layer caching optimized for faster builds
  - Implemented a workaround for cross-package dependencies in the monorepo
- Google authentication has been added to enhance the user authentication options
- Docker containers are configured to connect to local PostgreSQL
- The initial project structure is now in place and ready for feature development
