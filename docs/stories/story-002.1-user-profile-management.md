# Story: User Profile Management

**Status**: To Do

---

## Related Requirement
This story relates to the [Authentication and Security](../requirements.md#authentication-and-security) and [User Management](../requirements.md#user-management) sections of the requirements document, which specify the need for user profile data storage and management.

## Alignment with Design
This story aligns with the [Authentication and Authorization](../design.md#authentication-and-authorization) and [Data Model](../design.md#data-model) sections of the design document, which outline the user profile storage requirements.

## Dependent Stories
- Story 001.1: Firebase Authentication Implementation (must be completed first)
- Story 002: Local PostgreSQL and Schema Implementation (must be completed first)

## Acceptance Criteria
- User profiles are stored in the database when users authenticate
- User information from Google authentication (name, email, profile picture) is saved
- User profiles can be updated and managed
- User profile information is properly secured
- User profile data is accessible to authorized API endpoints

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement user profile management:
  - [ ] Create/update user records in database when users authenticate
  - [ ] Store Google authentication user information (name, email, profile picture)
  - [ ] Implement profile fetching from the database
  - [ ] Add user profile display in the UI
  - [ ] Add API endpoints for user profile management
- [ ] Enhance profile security:
  - [ ] Ensure profile data is only accessible to the authenticated user
  - [ ] Implement proper validation for profile updates
  - [ ] Add authorization checks to profile-related API endpoints
- [ ] Implement user profile UI:
  - [ ] Create a profile page showing user information
  - [ ] Create a profile editing form (if needed)
  - [ ] Display user profile information in relevant parts of the UI

## Notes
- This story was split from Story 001.1 as it depends on the database schema implementation in Story 002
- User profile management requires the database schema to be in place first
- We already have access to user profile data from Google authentication (name, email, profile picture)
- This story focuses on persisting and managing that data in our own database
- The core authentication functionality was completed in Story 001.1
- This story builds on the database schema created in Story 002
