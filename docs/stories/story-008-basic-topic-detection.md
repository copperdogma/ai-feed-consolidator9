# Story: Basic Topic Detection

**Status**: To Do

---

## Related Requirement
This story relates to the [Content Organization](../requirements.md#2-content-organization) section of the requirements document, specifically the "Topic Organization" requirements for automatic topic detection and grouping.

## Alignment with Design
This story aligns with the [Topic Detection and Management](../design.md#topic-detection-and-management) subsection in the Content Organization feature section of the design document.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Automatic topic detection is implemented
- Content is automatically categorized into topics
- Topics are stored and linked to content items
- Users can manually adjust topic assignments
- Content can be viewed grouped by topic
- Topic grouping works across different content sources
- Topics can be merged, split, renamed, and deleted
- Topic confidence scores are calculated and stored
- Topics are presented in a clear hierarchy or list

## Tasks
- [ ] Design topic detection algorithm:
  - [ ] Research natural language processing approaches
  - [ ] Evaluate OpenAI API for topic extraction
  - [ ] Determine balance between accuracy and performance
  - [ ] Define topic confidence scoring methodology
  - [ ] Create topic extraction rules for different content types
- [ ] Implement core topic detection:
  - [ ] Create topic extraction service
  - [ ] Implement text processing for topic identification

  - [ ] Implement content-by-topic view
- [ ] Create cross-platform topic alignment:
  - [ ] Implement topic normalization across sources
  - [ ] Create topic similarity detection
  - [ ] Add topic hierarchy or grouping
  - [ ] Implement related topics functionality
- [ ] Develop topic API endpoints:
  - [ ] Create topic CRUD operations
  - [ ] Implement topic assignment endpoints
  - [ ] Add topic suggestion API
  - [ ] Create topic search functionality
- [ ] Implement background topic processing:
  - [ ] Create background job for topic analysis
  - [ ] Implement incremental topic updates
  - [ ] Add topic re-analysis triggers
  - [ ] Create batch processing for efficiency

## Notes
- Topic detection quality is crucial for effective content organization
- Consider using a hybrid approach with AI and rule-based detection
- Topic detection should improve over time with user feedback
- Consider implementing topic suggestions for manual assignment
- Keep topic granularity configurable to match user preferences
- Database indexes will be important for topic-based content retrieval
- Be mindful of processing costs when using AI for topic detection
