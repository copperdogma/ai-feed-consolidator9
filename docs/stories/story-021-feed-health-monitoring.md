# Story: Feed Health Monitoring System

**Status**: To Do

---

## Related Requirement
This story relates to the [Content Integration](../requirements.md#content-integration) section of the requirements document, specifically improving the reliability and robustness of feed sources.

## Alignment with Design
This story enhances the [Content Integration](../design.md#feature-content-integration) section, particularly the RSS Feed Integration subsection, with more robust health monitoring and validation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A comprehensive feed health monitoring system is implemented
- Feed health status is tracked with detailed metrics
- Feed validation pipeline is enhanced with more robust error detection
- Different error categories are properly identified and handled
- Permanent vs. transient errors are distinguished
- Source-specific handlers exist for problematic feeds
- Graduated retry strategies are implemented based on error types
- Feed health dashboard is available to view source reliability
- Auto-disabling of consistently failing feeds is implemented with notification

## Tasks
- [ ] Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles for all implemented features:
  - [ ] Write tests before implementing the feature code
  - [ ] Ensure all code has appropriate test coverage
  - [ ] Run tests continuously during development
- [ ] Design feed health data model:
  - [ ] Create FeedHealth interface with comprehensive metrics
  - [ ] Implement database schema for health tracking
  - [ ] Define repository methods for health status updates
  - [ ] Create migration for existing feed sources
- [ ] Implement error categorization:
  - [ ] Define standardized feed error categories
  - [ ] Create detection logic for each error type
  - [ ] Implement permanent vs. transient error distinction
  - [ ] Build error pattern recognition system
- [ ] Create feed validation pipeline:
  - [ ] Implement staged validation process
  - [ ] Add DNS resolution check stage
  - [ ] Create HTTP status validation stage
  - [ ] Build content type verification stage
  - [ ] Implement XML/RSS format validation stage
  - [ ] Add content extraction stage
- [ ] Develop retry strategies:
  - [ ] Implement exponential backoff algorithm
  - [ ] Create category-specific retry policies
  - [ ] Build retry schedule management
  - [ ] Add circuit breaker pattern for persistent failures
- [ ] Implement source-specific handlers:
  - [ ] Create platform-specific adapters for problematic sources
  - [ ] Implement special handling for authentication requirements
  - [ ] Build custom header management for restricted feeds
  - [ ] Add user-agent rotation for blocking prevention
- [ ] Create health monitoring dashboard:
  - [ ] Implement feed health status overview
  - [ ] Create detailed error history view
  - [ ] Add manual intervention options
  - [ ] Build health trend visualization
- [ ] Implement auto-management features:
  - [ ] Create auto-disable logic for consistently failing feeds
  - [ ] Implement notification system for feed status changes
  - [ ] Build auto-recovery attempts for transient issues
  - [ ] Add manual override options

## Notes
- Focus on minimizing false positives in error detection
- Consider performance impact of extensive validation
- Utilize the error handling framework from Story 020
- Implement comprehensive logging for feed validation steps
- Consider creating a test suite with known problematic feeds
- Health monitoring should provide actionable insights
- Balance between automatic handling and manual intervention
- Consider creating a feed testing utility for new sources
