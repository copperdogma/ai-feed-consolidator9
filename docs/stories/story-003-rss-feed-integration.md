# Story: RSS Feed Integration

**Status**: To Do

---

## Related Requirement
This story relates to the [Content Integration](../requirements.md#1-content-integration) section of the requirements document, specifically the integration with "Direct RSS/Atom feeds" as a primary content source.

## Alignment with Design
This story aligns with the [RSS/Atom Feed Integration](../design.md#rssatom-feed-integration) subsection in the Content Integration feature section of the design document.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can add, edit, and remove RSS/Atom feed sources
- System can fetch content from RSS/Atom feeds at configurable intervals
- Feed content is parsed and stored in the database
- Metadata extraction is implemented for feed items
- Read/unread status is tracked for each feed item
- Feed items can be prioritized
- System handles various RSS and Atom formats correctly
- Error handling is robust for feed connectivity issues
- System respects HTTP caching headers for efficient fetching

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement RSS/Atom parser:
  - [ ] Evaluate and select RSS/Atom parsing library
  - [ ] Implement support for RSS 2.0 format
  - [ ] Implement support for Atom format
  - [ ] Add support for feed autodiscovery
  - [ ] Create validation for feed URLs
- [ ] Create feed management components:
  - [ ] Implement feed source repository
  - [ ] Create feed configuration UI
  - [ ] Implement feed testing functionality
  - [ ] Create feed categorization options
- [ ] Develop feed fetching service:
  - [ ] Implement feed polling mechanism
  - [ ] Create configurable polling intervals
  - [ ] Add support for HTTP caching headers (ETag, Last-Modified)
  - [ ] Implement parallel feed fetching
  - [ ] Add feed health monitoring
- [ ] Create feed item processor:
  - [ ] Parse feed items into Content model
  - [ ] Extract and store metadata
  - [ ] Handle images and enclosures
  - [ ] Process item links and references
  - [ ] Implement duplicate detection
- [ ] Develop UI components:
  - [ ] Create feed list view
  - [ ] Implement feed item view
  - [ ] Create feed management screens
  - [ ] Add feed item filtering options
  - [ ] Implement unread/read toggle
- [ ] Implement error handling:
  - [ ] Handle network connectivity issues
  - [ ] Process malformed feeds gracefully
  - [ ] Add retry mechanism for failed fetches
  - [ ] Implement feed error reporting
  - [ ] Create feed health dashboard
- [ ] Test with diverse feed sources:
  - [ ] Test with various popular blogs
  - [ ] Test with news sites
  - [ ] Test with podcast feeds
  - [ ] Test with non-standard feed implementations
  - [ ] Test with secure (HTTPS) and non-secure feeds

## Notes
- RSS/Atom feeds are a cornerstone of content integration and should be robust
- Consider implementing feed autodiscovery for websites that don't explicitly show feed URLs
- Some feeds may require authentication
- Consider handling browser-based feed import (OPML format)
- Content cleanup may be needed for feeds with partial content or ads
- Feed refresh rates should be configurable per feed to respect high-volume sources
