**Status**: Done

---

## Related Requirement
This story relates to the [Content Integration](../requirements.md#1-content-integration) section of the requirements document, specifically the integration with "Direct RSS/Atom feeds" as a primary content source.

## Alignment with Design
This story aligns with the [RSS/Atom Feed Integration](../design.md#rssatom-feed-integration) subsection in the Content Integration feature section of the design document.

## Implementation Summary

The RSS Feed Integration has been successfully implemented with the following key components:

### Database Schema
- Added Source model with fields for feed URL, name, type, status, and metadata
- Added Content model with relationships to Source, User, and other entities
- Created appropriate indexes and constraints for optimal performance

### Feed Service
- Implemented RssFeedService with methods for:
  - Feed URL validation
  - Adding new feed sources
  - Fetching and processing feed content
  - Refreshing feeds on a schedule
- Used the rss-parser package for handling RSS/Atom feeds
- Added error handling for network and parsing issues

### Background Processing
- Created FeedRefreshService for automatic background feed refreshing
- Implemented configurable refresh intervals
- Built an AppStartupService to initialize background services on application start
- Added graceful shutdown handling for background processes
- Implemented admin controls for starting/stopping the refresh service

### API Endpoints
- Created feed router with endpoints for:
  - Adding new feed sources
  - Updating existing sources
  - Deleting sources
  - Fetching feed content
  - Testing feed URLs before adding
- Implemented admin router with endpoints for controlling the feed refresh service

### User Interface
- Built Feed Management page with:
  - List view of all feed sources
  - Add/Edit/Delete functionality for sources
  - Validation of feed URLs
  - Auto-population of feed names from feed titles
  - Manual refresh capability
  - Status indicators for feeds

### Testing
- Followed Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach throughout implementation
- Achieved over 90% code coverage for all components
- Created comprehensive test suites for:
  - RSS Feed Service
  - Feed Refresh Service
  - App Startup Service
  - Feed Router API endpoints
  - Admin Router endpoints
- Setup Vitest alongside Jest for testing modern ESM modules
- Created mock strategies for testing tRPC routers
- Added test fixtures and mock data for RSS feeds

### Performance & Reliability
- Implemented parallel feed processing
- Added support for HTTP caching headers
- Created robust error handling for network and parsing issues
- Implemented retry mechanisms for failed fetches
- Added logging for debugging and monitoring

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all components (repositories, services, utilities)
- Integration tests for feed fetching and processing
- Mock external dependencies (feed endpoints) for reliable testing
- Test different feed formats (RSS 2.0, Atom, etc.)
- Test error handling for various failure scenarios
- Test performance with high-volume feeds
- Test parsing edge cases and malformed feeds

## Notes
- RSS/Atom feeds are a cornerstone of content integration and should be robust
- Consider implementing feed autodiscovery for websites that don't explicitly show feed URLs
- Some feeds may require authentication
- Consider handling browser-based feed import (OPML format)
- Content cleanup may be needed for feeds with partial content or ads
- Feed refresh rates should be configurable per feed to respect high-volume sources

## Implementation Details

### Feed Management UI
- Created a Feed Management page with the following features:
  - List all feed sources with their details
  - Add new feed sources with automatic URL detection and validation
  - Edit existing feed sources
  - Delete feed sources
  - Manually refresh feeds to update content

### Enhanced Feed Addition Experience
- Implemented a streamlined feed addition process:
  - Users can enter either a website URL or direct feed URL
  - The system automatically detects the URL type and processes it accordingly 
  - For feed URLs: validates the feed and extracts the feed title
  - For website URLs: discovers available feeds and lets the user select one
  - Form fields are auto-populated where possible
  - Processing happens automatically in the background
  - Users see real-time feedback on the validation/discovery process
  - Simplified interface with single-step submission once fields are populated
