# Story: Firebase Authentication Implementation and Integration

**Status**: Partially Complete (Core Authentication Implemented)

---

## Related Requirement
This story relates to the [Authentication and Security](../requirements.md#authentication-and-security) section of the requirements document, which specifies the need for secure user authentication and access control.

## Alignment with Design
This story aligns with the [Authentication and Authorization](../design.md#authentication-and-authorization) section of the design document, which outlines the use of Firebase Authentication for user management.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] A real Firebase project is created and properly configured
- [x] Google authentication works correctly
- [x] Users can sign in with Google
- [x] Users can log out
- [x] Authentication state persists across page refreshes
- [x] Protected routes only allow authenticated users
- [ ] User profiles are stored in the database
- [ ] Authentication errors are properly handled and displayed to users

## Tasks
- [x] Create a new Firebase project in the Firebase console:
  - [x] Go to the Firebase console (https://console.firebase.google.com/)
  - [x] Create a new project for AI Feed Consolidator
  - [x] Configure project settings (location, analytics, etc.)
- [x] Configure authentication methods:
  - [x] Enable Google authentication
  - [x] Configure OAuth consent screen for Google authentication
  - [x] Set up authorized domains for authentication
- [x] Update environment variables:
  - [x] Replace test Firebase credentials with real credentials in .env file
  - [x] Ensure all required Firebase environment variables are properly set
  - [x] Update Firebase Admin SDK credentials for server authentication
- [x] Simplify authentication UI:
  - [x] Remove email/password authentication forms
  - [x] Add Google sign-in button to the login page
  - [x] Fix TRPC-related errors in authentication code
- [x] Test authentication flow:
  - [x] Verify Google authentication
  - [x] Verify logout functionality
  - [x] Verify authentication persistence
  - [x] Add logout button to home page

### Remaining Tasks (May be moved to Story 002)
- [ ] Implement user profile management:
  - [ ] Create/update user records in database when users authenticate
  - [ ] Store additional user information (name, profile picture, etc.)
  - [ ] Implement profile editing functionality
- [ ] Enhance error handling:
  - [ ] Add proper error messages for authentication failures
  - [ ] Handle edge cases (account linking, etc.)
  - [ ] Create user-friendly error displays
- [ ] Secure routes and API endpoints:
  - [ ] Verify protected routes redirect unauthenticated users
  - [ ] Ensure API endpoints check for valid authentication
  - [ ] Test authorization with different user roles
- [ ] Documentation:
  - [ ] Document Firebase project setup process
  - [ ] Update .env.example with required Firebase variables
  - [ ] Add detailed Firebase configuration notes to project documentation

## Notes
- Core Firebase authentication with Google sign-in is now fully implemented and working
- The remaining tasks for user profile management may be better handled after implementing the database schema in Story 002
- This story builds on the infrastructure created in Story 001 and replaces test credentials with real ones
- Simplified authentication to use only Google Sign-in for better user experience
- The remaining tasks related to storing user profiles in the database require the database schema to be implemented first
- Consider marking this story as partially complete and moving the user profile management tasks to Story 002 (Local PostgreSQL and Schema Implementation)
