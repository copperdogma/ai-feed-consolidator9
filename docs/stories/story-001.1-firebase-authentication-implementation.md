# Story: Firebase Authentication Implementation and Integration

**Status**: To Do

---

## Related Requirement
This story relates to the [Authentication and Security](../requirements.md#authentication-and-security) section of the requirements document, which specifies the need for secure user authentication and access control.

## Alignment with Design
This story aligns with the [Authentication and Authorization](../design.md#authentication-and-authorization) section of the design document, which outlines the use of Firebase Authentication for user management.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A real Firebase project is created and properly configured
- Email/Password authentication works correctly
- Google authentication works correctly
- Users can sign up for new accounts
- Users can log in with existing accounts
- Users can log out
- Authentication state persists across page refreshes
- Protected routes only allow authenticated users
- User profiles are stored in the database
- Authentication errors are properly handled and displayed to users

## Tasks
- [ ] Create a new Firebase project in the Firebase console:
  - [ ] Go to the Firebase console (https://console.firebase.google.com/)
  - [ ] Create a new project for AI Feed Consolidator
  - [ ] Configure project settings (location, analytics, etc.)
- [ ] Configure authentication methods:
  - [ ] Enable Email/Password authentication
  - [ ] Enable Google authentication
  - [ ] Configure OAuth consent screen for Google authentication
  - [ ] Set up authorized domains for authentication
- [ ] Update environment variables:
  - [ ] Replace test Firebase credentials with real credentials in .env file
  - [ ] Ensure all required Firebase environment variables are properly set
  - [ ] Update Firebase Admin SDK credentials for server authentication
- [ ] Test authentication flow:
  - [ ] Verify user registration with email/password
  - [ ] Verify login with email/password
  - [ ] Verify Google authentication
  - [ ] Verify logout functionality
  - [ ] Verify authentication persistence
- [ ] Implement user profile management:
  - [ ] Create/update user records in database when users authenticate
  - [ ] Store additional user information (name, profile picture, etc.)
  - [ ] Implement profile editing functionality
- [ ] Enhance error handling:
  - [ ] Add proper error messages for authentication failures
  - [ ] Handle edge cases (password reset, email verification, etc.)
  - [ ] Create user-friendly error displays
- [ ] Secure routes and API endpoints:
  - [ ] Verify protected routes redirect unauthenticated users
  - [ ] Ensure API endpoints check for valid authentication
  - [ ] Test authorization with different user roles
- [ ] Documentation:
  - [ ] Document Firebase project setup process
  - [ ] Update .env.example with required Firebase variables
  - [ ] Add detailed Firebase configuration notes to project documentation

## Notes
- This story is critical for enabling any user-specific functionality in the application
- Using real Firebase credentials is necessary for authentication testing
- The Firebase project should be configured for development use initially
- Consider setting up separate Firebase projects for development and production
- Firebase Authentication should be fully functional before proceeding with other user-specific features
- Error handling is critical for providing a good user experience
- Security rules should be configured to protect user data
- This story builds on the infrastructure created in Story 001 but replaces test credentials with real ones
