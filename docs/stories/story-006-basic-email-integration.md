## Notes
- Email authentication requires secure credential storage
- Consider using OAuth for supported email providers
- Processing HTML emails can be complex due to varied formatting
- URL extraction should handle various link formats
- Consider privacy implications of email content storage
- Filter settings should be configurable to match user workflow
- Some email providers may have connection or rate limitations
