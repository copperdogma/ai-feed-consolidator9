# Content Value Evaluation Metrics

This document defines metrics and evaluation approaches for assessing the quality of summaries and content analysis in the AI Feed Consolidator. These metrics are derived from the [Content Value Principles](./content-value-principles.md) and provide concrete ways to measure the effectiveness of our content processing features.

## Purpose

These metrics serve to:
1. Provide objective criteria for evaluating summary and analysis quality
2. Guide improvements to the summarization and analysis algorithms
3. Track the effectiveness of changes to the system over time
4. Enable automated quality testing of content processing
5. Inform user experience improvements

## Core Metrics

### 1. Answer Completeness Score

**Definition**: Measures how well a summary anticipates and addresses the natural follow-up questions a user might have.

**Measurement Method**:
- Generate a set of content-type specific questions for a piece of content
- Evaluate whether the summary provides answers to each question
- Calculate: (Number of questions answered / Total questions) * 100

**Target Values**:
- Quick Summary: ≥ 60%
- Detailed Summary: ≥ 80% 
- Deep Analysis: ≥ 90%

### 2. Information Density Ratio

**Definition**: Measures the balance between conciseness and information preservation.

**Measurement Method**:
- Count key information units in original content
- Count key information units preserved in summary
- Calculate: (Information units in summary / Information units in original) / (Summary length / Original length)

**Target Values**:
- Quick Summary: ≥ 3.0
- Detailed Summary: ≥ 2.0
- Deep Analysis: Not applicable (focuses on expansion rather than condensation)

### 3. Content Value Principle Coverage

**Definition**: Measures how comprehensively a summary or analysis addresses all five Content Value Principles.

**Measurement Method**:
- Evaluate coverage of each principle on a scale of 0-2:
  - 0: Not addressed
  - 1: Partially addressed
  - 2: Fully addressed
- Calculate: (Sum of scores across all principles / 10) * 100

**Target Values**:
- Quick Summary: ≥ 60%
- Detailed Summary: ≥ 80%
- Deep Analysis: ≥ 90%

### 4. User Satisfaction Rating

**Definition**: Direct user feedback on summary or analysis quality.

**Measurement Method**:
- Collect user ratings on a 1-5 scale
- Track average rating per content type and summary level

**Target Values**:
- All summary types: ≥ 4.0

### 5. Accuracy Assessment

**Definition**: Measures factual correctness and avoidance of hallucination or misrepresentation.

**Measurement Method**:
- Expert review of sample summaries against original content
- Flag and categorize inaccuracies
- Calculate: (1 - (Number of inaccuracies / Information units in summary)) * 100

**Target Values**:
- All summary types: ≥ 95%

## Content Type-Specific Metrics

Different content types emphasize different Content Value Principles. These specialized metrics help evaluate how well summaries address the most important aspects for each content type.

### Technical Content

- **Technical Accuracy Score**: Measures correctness of technical details
- **Technical Context Preservation**: Assesses how well implementation details, requirements, and constraints are maintained

### News Content

- **Timeliness Indicator**: Measures whether time-sensitive elements are highlighted
- **Factual Density**: Ratio of verifiable facts to interpretive statements

### Analysis Content

- **Perspective Balance Score**: Measures inclusion of multiple viewpoints
- **Framework Clarity**: Assesses how well analytical frameworks are preserved

### Tutorial Content

- **Procedural Clarity**: Measures whether key steps and sequences are preserved
- **Purpose Clarity**: Assesses how well the tutorial's goals are communicated

### Entertainment Content

- **Engagement Preservation**: Measures how well the engaging elements are maintained
- **Cultural Context Score**: Assesses preservation of relevant cultural references

## Implementation Strategy

### Automated Metrics

The following metrics can be implemented programmatically:
- Information Density Ratio
- User Satisfaction Rating (collection mechanism)
- Basic Content Value Principle Coverage (using NLP techniques)

### Semi-Automated Metrics

These metrics require a combination of automated tools and human review:
- Answer Completeness Score (question generation can be automated)
- Content-type specific metrics (some aspects can be automatically evaluated)

### Manual Assessment Metrics

These metrics initially require human evaluation:
- Accuracy Assessment
- Detailed Content Value Principle Coverage

## Integration with Testing Framework

These metrics should be integrated with the Answer-Forward Testing framework:

1. **Continuous Monitoring**: Run automated metrics on a sample of processed content daily
2. **Regression Testing**: Compare metrics before and after system changes
3. **A/B Testing**: Use metrics to compare alternative summarization approaches
4. **User Feedback Loop**: Correlate metric scores with user satisfaction

## Dashboard and Reporting

A metrics dashboard should be implemented to:

1. Track metric trends over time
2. Highlight areas for improvement
3. Compare performance across content types
4. Alert when metrics fall below target thresholds
5. Provide detailed breakdowns for investigation

## Future Enhancements

As the system evolves, consider:

1. Machine learning models to predict human-assessed metrics
2. Expanded content type-specific metrics
3. Competitive benchmarking against other summarization tools
4. Integration with content recommendation algorithms
5. User-customizable metric weightings based on individual preferences
