## Notes
- Stories are organized in a logical implementation order
- High priority stories represent the core MVP functionality
- Medium priority stories represent important but not critical functionality
- Stories may be broken down further during implementation
- Additional stories may be added as the project progresses
- Story 001.1 (Firebase Authentication) has been completed with core authentication implemented
- User profile management tasks have been moved to Story 002.1, which depends on Story 002 (database schema)
