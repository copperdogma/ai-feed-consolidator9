## Notes
- Stories are organized in a logical implementation order
- High priority stories represent the core MVP functionality
- Medium priority stories represent important but not critical functionality
- Stories may be broken down further during implementation
- Additional stories may be added as the project progresses
- All completed stories require explicit user sign-off before being marked as "Done"
- Story 001.1 (Firebase Authentication) has been completed with core authentication implemented
- User profile management tasks have been moved to Story 002.1, which depends on Story 002 (database schema)
- Story 002 (Local PostgreSQL and Schema Implementation) is completed with database schema defined, repository pattern implemented, and comprehensive documentation added
- Story 002.1 (User Profile Management) is completed with user profile creation, retrieval, and update functionality implemented, along with comprehensive tests for all repository classes
- Story 003 (RSS Feed Integration) is completed with feed validation, management, background refresh service, and comprehensive tests implemented
- Stories 004, 005, and 006 (YouTube, Twitter/X, and Email integrations) have been reprioritized to follow Story 011, allowing focus on working with the RSS content before adding more data sources
- Stories 017, 018, and 019 are derived from insights in the legacy content-summarizer.md document and provide enhanced summarization capabilities
- Stories 020, 021, 022, and 023 are derived from valuable patterns in the legacy design.md document and enhance system reliability and observability
- Story 024 implements the gptAnalyze feature from the legacy gpt-analyze.md document to provide cost-effective deep analysis
- Story 025 creates a dashboard for tracking content quality metrics based on Content Value Principles
