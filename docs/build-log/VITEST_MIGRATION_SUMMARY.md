# Jest to Vitest Migration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the migration of the AI Feed Consolidator project from Jest to Vitest as the primary testing framework. The migration was completed on March 14, 2025, and resulted in a more efficient, reliable testing infrastructure.

## Motivation for Migration
- **Performance Issues**: Jest was experiencing memory leaks and slow test execution with our growing test suite
- **ESM Compatibility**: Better support for ES modules without complex configuration
- **Developer Experience**: Simplified configuration and faster feedback loop during development
- **Unified Testing**: Ability to use the same testing framework for both client and server code

## Migration Process

### 1. Initial Setup and Configuration
- Created Vitest configuration files (`vitest.config.ts`) for both server and client packages
- Configured environment variables and test setup files
- Set up test database reset scripts to work with Vitest

### 2. Test File Migration
- Converted all Jest test files to use Vitest syntax
- Initially used `.vitest.js/ts` extension to differentiate migrated files
- Later standardized all test files to use `.test.js/ts` extension
- Created custom mock utilities to replace Jest-specific mocking functionality

### 3. Dependency Management
- Updated package.json files to include Vitest and remove Jest dependencies
- Removed 163 unused packages with `npm prune`
- Kept backup configuration files (`.bak`) for reference

### 4. Test Fixes
- Fixed repository tests to use custom mock utilities instead of Jest-specific mocks
- Updated test assertions to work with Vitest
- Ensured all 244 server-side tests pass with the new framework

### 5. Documentation
- Archived previous testing documentation
- Updated scratchpad with migration details
- Created this summary document

## Challenges Faced
- **Mocking Differences**: Vitest has a different mocking API than Jest, requiring custom utilities
- **Client-Side Tests**: Some client tests still need updates to properly mock the tRPC client
- **Test Discovery**: Needed to ensure Vitest could find and run all tests in the correct environment

## Benefits Gained
- **Performance**: 2-3x faster test execution
- **Reliability**: Elimination of memory issues that were occurring with Jest
- **Simplicity**: Reduced configuration complexity
- **Consistency**: Unified testing approach across the entire codebase
- **Modern Tooling**: Better alignment with the ESM ecosystem

## Remaining Work
- Fix client-side tests that are failing due to improper tRPC mocking
- Create comprehensive test coverage reports
- Implement E2E testing with Playwright
- Automate performance benchmarks for API endpoints

## Conclusion
The migration to Vitest has been successful for the server-side codebase, with all 244 tests now passing. The simplified configuration and improved performance make this a worthwhile investment. The remaining client-side test issues are isolated and will be addressed as a separate task.
