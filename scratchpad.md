## Temp TODO:
- [ ] Document we're developing using this: https://github.com/AgentDeskAI/browser-tools-mcp
- [ ] Document we're developing using this (mcp-server-git): https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/git


## Current Story
**Story 001.1: Firebase Authentication Implementation**

This story involves creating an actual Firebase project and implementing real authentication functionality to replace the mock/test credentials currently in place.

## Current Task
Create a real Firebase project and configure it for authentication.

## Plan Checklist
- [ ] Create a new Firebase project in the Firebase console:
  - [ ] Go to the Firebase console (https://console.firebase.google.com/)
  - [ ] Create a new project for AI Feed Consolidator
  - [ ] Configure project settings (location, analytics, etc.)
- [ ] Configure authentication methods:
  - [ ] Enable Email/Password authentication
  - [ ] Enable Google authentication
  - [ ] Configure OAuth consent screen for Google authentication
  - [ ] Set up authorized domains for authentication
- [ ] Update environment variables:
  - [ ] Replace test Firebase credentials with real credentials in .env file
  - [ ] Ensure all required Firebase environment variables are properly set
  - [ ] Update Firebase Admin SDK credentials for server authentication
- [ ] Test authentication flow:
  - [ ] Verify user registration with email/password
  - [ ] Verify login with email/password
  - [ ] Verify Google authentication
  - [ ] Verify logout functionality
  - [ ] Verify authentication persistence
- [ ] Implement user profile management:
  - [ ] Create/update user records in database when users authenticate
  - [ ] Store additional user information (name, profile picture, etc.)
  - [ ] Implement profile editing functionality

## Issues/Blockers
- Firebase Authentication is currently configured with mock/test credentials, so users cannot actually log in
- Need to create a real Firebase project and update environment variables with actual credentials

## Recently Completed
- Added a new high-priority story (001.1) for Firebase Authentication Implementation
- Identified that while the authentication code is in place, it's using test credentials
- Successfully completed Story 001 (Project Setup and Infrastructure)
- Fixed Docker container configuration for Firebase integration
- Set up mock Firebase credentials for development
- Successfully running both client and server containers
- Fixed Firebase Admin initialization to work in development mode
- Verified that Firebase Authentication UI components are already implemented
- Added Google authentication buttons to both SignInButton and SignUpButton components
- Implemented hot reloading for development
- Created documentation for Docker configuration and development tools

## Decisions Made
- Need to implement real Firebase authentication before proceeding with other features
- Added a new story (001.1) with high priority to address the Firebase authentication implementation
- Using a monorepo structure with client and server packages
- Using tRPC for type-safe API communication instead of REST
- Using Prisma for database access
- Using Firebase for authentication
- Using Docker for containerization of server and client (not database)
- Running PostgreSQL locally on the host machine
- Added Google authentication as an enhancement to the existing authentication UI
- Implemented Docker hot reloading using volume mounts for a better development experience

## Lessons Learned
- Having placeholder Firebase credentials in the code isn't sufficient; real credentials are needed
- Firebase Admin SDK initialization requires special handling in development mode
- Docker containers need careful configuration to work with Firebase
- Environment variables must be properly passed to Docker containers
- The Evergreen UI library doesn't have a Divider component, but we can simulate one using a Pane with height=1 and appropriate background color
- Vite's dependency scanning can look for tsconfig.json files in unexpected locations, requiring workarounds
- Volume mounts in Docker need special handling for node_modules to prevent conflicts

**Next Steps:**
We have successfully completed Story 001 (Project Setup and Infrastructure) and identified the need for a new high-priority story (001.1) for Firebase Authentication Implementation. We need to create a real Firebase project and implement the authentication flow with real credentials before proceeding with other stories.
