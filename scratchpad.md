# Scratchpad - Work Phase

**NOTE: All To Do items should be added as checklists**

## Current Story
Story 003: RSS Feed Integration - **COMPLETED**


## New Tasks
- [ ] Why are we using both vitest AND jest for testing? Should we use only one? Does it make sense to use both?
- [x] Allow the user to add a feed with a single url. If it's a feed, find the site title and fill in that box. If it's a site name/url, find the site title and fill in that box and try to find the feed url from the site and fill in THAT box.

## Current Task
- [x] Review available stories from the backlog
- [x] Select the next story to work on
- [x] Set up the testing structure for RSS Feed Implementation
- [x] Update Prisma schema to include Source and Content models for RSS Feed Integration
- [x] Create test fixtures for RSS feeds
- [x] Install the necessary RSS parser package
- [x] Run tests to verify tests are correctly written
- [x] Complete the RSS Feed Service implementation
- [x] Create the API endpoint for RSS Feed management

- [x] Obtain user sign-off for completion of Story 003 (retroactively added to reflect process update)
- [x] Update project documentation to require user sign-off before marking stories as complete
- [x] Enhance feed discovery to allow adding feeds by providing a website URL, not just the exact feed URL

## Current Plan (Add Feed URL Enhancement)
- [x] Write tests for the streamlined feed addition process
- [x] Update the AddFeedForm component UI to simplify the interface
