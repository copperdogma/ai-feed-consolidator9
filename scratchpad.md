# Scratchpad - Work Phase

Suggested headings: Current Story, Current Task, Plan Checklist, Issues/Blockers, Recently Completed, Decisions Made, Lessons Learned

## Temp TODO:
- [ ] Document we're developing using this: https://github.com/AgentDeskAI/browser-tools-mcp
- [ ] Document we're developing using this (mcp-server-git): https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/git


## Current Story
Story 001.1 (Firebase Authentication Implementation) has been completed, and we're ready to move on to Story 002 (Local PostgreSQL and Schema Implementation).

## Current Task
Prepare for work on Story 002 (Local PostgreSQL and Schema Implementation).

## Recently Completed Tasks
- [x] Split Story 001.1 to separate authentication from user profile management
- [x] Created new Story 002.1 for User Profile Management
- [x] Marked Story 001.1 as "Done" instead of "Partially Complete"
- [x] Updated the stories.md index to reflect these changes
- [x] Reorganized documentation to clarify the dependencies between stories

## Authentication Implementation Completed
- [x] Create a new Firebase project in the Firebase console
- [x] Configure authentication methods (Google authentication)
- [x] Update environment variables with real Firebase credentials
- [x] Simplify authentication UI to use only Google Sign-in
- [x] Test authentication flow and verify it works correctly
- [x] Add logout button to the home page and enhance the UI
- [x] Fix Google authentication issues (TRPC dependencies, etc.)

## Issues/Blockers
- None currently - Firebase authentication is complete and working

## Recently Completed
- Reorganized project stories to better reflect dependencies
- Created Story 002.1 (User Profile Management) that depends on Story 002 
- Successfully implemented and tested Google authentication flow
- Added logout button to the home page with a user-friendly header
- Added personalized welcome message showing the user's name from Google profile
- Simplified authentication UI to only use Google sign-in
- Fixed TRPC errors in the authentication code
- Verified authentication persists after page refresh
- Created a real Firebase project with proper credentials

## Decisions Made
- Split Story 001.1 into two parts:
  - Core authentication (Story 001.1) - now marked as DONE
  - User profile management (New Story 002.1) - depends on database schema
- This separation clarifies the technical dependencies and creates a cleaner project flow
- Core authentication doesn't require database schema and is independently functional
- User profile management logically depends on having a database schema in place first
- Simplified the authentication to use only Google sign-in for better user experience
- Enhanced the home page with a header, app name, and dedicated logout button
- Added personalized welcome message showing the user's name from their Google account
- Removed TRPC dependencies from authentication code to fix errors
- Removed Firebase measurement ID since analytics is not being used

## Lessons Learned
- Breaking stories along technical dependency lines creates clearer, more manageable work
- Google authentication provides a superior user experience compared to email/password
- Firebase's Google sign-in provides user profile data automatically (name, email, profile picture)
- Adding personalized elements like user's name creates a better user experience
- TRPC utilities can cause issues if not properly initialized or if they're not available
- Firebase Admin SDK initialization requires special handling in development mode

## Next Steps
1. Begin work on Story 002 (Local PostgreSQL and Schema Implementation):
   - Set up local PostgreSQL database properly
   - Design and implement database schema
   - Create necessary tables for users, feeds, content, etc.
   - Set up Prisma ORM for database interactions

2. Then proceed to Story 002.1 (User Profile Management):
   - Implement storage of user profile data in the database
   - Create API endpoints for user profile management
   - Enhance the UI to display and edit user profiles
