## Temp TODO:
- [ ] Document we're developing using this: https://github.com/AgentDeskAI/browser-tools-mcp
- [ ] Document we're developing using this (mcp-server-git): https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/git


## Current Story
**Story 001.1: Firebase Authentication Implementation**

This story involves implementing real authentication functionality using the Firebase project that has been created.

## Current Task
Decide whether to complete the user profile management portion of Story 001.1 or consider the authentication portion complete and move on to Story 002.

## Plan Checklist
- [x] Create a new Firebase project in the Firebase console
- [x] Configure authentication methods
- [x] Update environment variables
- [x] Simplify authentication UI to use only Google Sign-in
- [x] Test authentication flow
- [ ] Implement user profile management:
  - [ ] Create/update user records in database when users authenticate
  - [ ] Store additional user information (name, profile picture, etc.)
  - [ ] Implement profile editing functionality
- [ ] Enhance error handling
- [ ] Secure routes and API endpoints
- [ ] Documentation

## Authentication Implementation Completed
- [x] Create a new Firebase project in the Firebase console:
  - [x] Go to the Firebase console
  - [x] Create a new project for AI Feed Consolidator
  - [x] Configure project settings
- [x] Configure authentication methods:
  - [x] Enable Google authentication
  - [x] Configure OAuth consent screen for Google authentication
  - [x] Set up authorized domains for authentication
- [x] Update environment variables:
  - [x] Replace test Firebase credentials with real credentials in .env file
  - [x] Ensure all required Firebase environment variables are properly set
  - [x] Update Firebase Admin SDK credentials for server authentication
- [x] Simplify authentication UI to use only Google Sign-in:
  - [x] Remove email/password sign-in/sign-up forms
  - [x] Add prominent Google sign-in button to the Login page
  - [x] Update NavBar to show appropriate authentication UI
- [x] Test authentication flow:
  - [x] Verify Google authentication
  - [x] Verify logout functionality
  - [x] Verify authentication persistence
  - [x] Add logout button to home page
- [x] Fix Google authentication issues
  - [x] Remove TRPC dependencies from authentication code
  - [x] Handle authentication errors properly
  - [x] Ensure Firebase credentials are working correctly

## Issues/Blockers
- None currently - Firebase authentication is working perfectly

## Recently Completed
- Successfully implemented and tested Google authentication flow
- Added logout button to the home page with a user-friendly header
- Added personalized welcome message showing the user's name from Google profile
- Simplified authentication UI to only use Google sign-in
- Fixed TRPC errors in the authentication code
- Verified authentication persists after page refresh
- Created a real Firebase project with proper credentials

## Decisions Made
- Simplified the authentication to use only Google sign-in for better user experience
- Enhanced the home page with a header, app name, and dedicated logout button
- Added personalized welcome message showing the user's name from their Google account
- Removed TRPC dependencies from authentication code to fix errors
- Removed Firebase measurement ID since analytics is not being used

## Lessons Learned
- Google authentication provides a superior user experience compared to email/password
- Firebase's Google sign-in provides user profile data automatically (name, email, profile picture)
- Adding personalized elements like user's name creates a better user experience
- TRPC utilities can cause issues if not properly initialized or if they're not available
- Firebase Admin SDK initialization requires special handling in development mode

## Next Steps Decision
We now have two options for how to proceed:

1. **Complete User Profile Management**:
   - Implement database storage of user profiles
   - Create/update user records when they authenticate
   - Store additional user information from Google profile
   - Implement profile editing functionality

2. **Move to Story 002: Local PostgreSQL and Schema Implementation**:
   - Consider the authentication portion complete
   - Implement the database schema needed for all application features
   - Set up proper relationships between users and other data
   - User profile management could be handled as part of this story

The second option might make more sense since we need to implement the database schema before we can properly store user profiles. Story 002 focuses on setting up the local PostgreSQL database and implementing the schema, which would provide the foundation for user profile management.
