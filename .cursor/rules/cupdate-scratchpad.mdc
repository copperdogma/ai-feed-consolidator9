# Update the Scratchpad

Take stock of what you're doing and what you've done.

Read the [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) and update it, leaning toward recording:
- What you're currently working on
- Your progress
- What you've learned, especially recording what you've tried that's failed so it doesn't get tried again in the future.
- Keep [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) tidy and organized.

If you think you're done your current task, check all of the seemingly outstanding work in [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) and verify it's complete. If it is, mark it done or delete it.
