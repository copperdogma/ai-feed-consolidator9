# Creating a Milestone

NOTE: If you weren't given access to @Diff you can't do this job. Halt and ask for @Diff access.

1. Check the @Diff to get a sense of what was done.
2. Add a new milestone to the top of [log.md](mdc:docs/log.md) with the changes
3. Check all changes into main using: git add .
4. Commit, adding an appropriate commit message based on the @Diff
5. Push to main
