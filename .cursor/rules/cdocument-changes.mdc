If you've just made major changes to the code or architecture, see [project-management.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/project-management.mdc) for details on how and where those changes should be documented.

Then go ahead and modify the documentation accordin to [project-management.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/project-management.mdc).
